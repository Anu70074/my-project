Project Description – Live Character Counter

Overview
---------
This project is a Live Character Counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to type text inside an input box and instantly displays the number of characters typed.
The layout is styled using CSS for a clean and centered interface.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- HTML5 – for structure
- CSS3 – for styling and layout
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – for live character counting

Files
-----
1. index.html – Main structure and JavaScript logic.
2. style-4.css – Stylesheet for layout and design.

index.html (HTML + JavaScript)
------------------------------
Purpose:
- Provides the input field for typing text.
- Displays the live character count.
- Uses JavaScript to update character count dynamically.

Key Features:
- <input> field for text input.
- <span> inside <h4> to display character count.
- JavaScript addEventListener('input', …) triggers on every keystroke.
- Updates character count in real-time using .value.length.

style-4.css (CSS Styling)
--------------------------
Purpose:
- Centers content vertically and horizontally.
- Provides spacing and clean font.
- Makes the input box user-friendly and neat.

Key Features:
- display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; → centers everything.
- min-height: 100vh; → fills the whole screen height.
- Input field styled with padding, font-size, and width.
- Headings styled with margins for spacing.

How It Works
------------
1. User starts typing in the input field.
2. JavaScript captures the input using textInput.value.length.
3. The character count is displayed instantly in the <span> element.
4. CSS ensures the interface is clean, centered, and easy to use.

Possible Enhancements
---------------------
- Add word counter alongside character counter.
- Set a maximum character limit (e.g., 100/200 characters).
- Add color change effect when limit is reached.
- Show remaining characters instead of total typed.
