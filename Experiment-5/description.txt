Project Description – Character Counter & Product Filter

=======================================================

1) Live Character Counter
-------------------------
Overview:
This project is a simple Live Character Counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to type text inside an input box and instantly displays the number of characters typed.

Files:
- index.html – Contains the input field, character counter display, and JavaScript logic.
- style-4.css – Stylesheet to center content and style input/heading.

How It Works:
1. User types text into the input box.
2. JavaScript captures input using textInput.value.length.
3. The character count updates instantly in the span element.
4. CSS centers content and makes it look clean.

Key Features:
- Real-time character count updates.
- Clean, centered layout with simple styling.
- Easy to expand (e.g., adding word count or character limit).

Possible Enhancements:
- Add word counter.
- Set maximum character limit (e.g., 100/200 characters).
- Show remaining characters instead of total typed.


2) Product Filter by Category
-----------------------------
Overview:
This project is a Product List with filtering functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to filter products by category (Clothing, Electronics, Books, or All).

Files:  
- index.html – Contains dropdown menu for categories and product list.
- style-5.css – Stylesheet for product boxes and dropdown design.

How It Works:
1. Products are grouped into categories using CSS classes (e.g., clothing, electronics, books).
2. A dropdown menu lets the user select a category.
3. JavaScript listens for changes in the dropdown and shows/hides products based on the selected category.
4. CSS styles the products with borders, padding, and spacing for readability.

Key Features:
- Dropdown-based product filtering.
- Simple styling with borders and spacing.
- Real-time updates without reloading the page.

Possible Enhancements:
- Add a search bar to filter by product name.
- Allow multiple category selections with checkboxes.
- Use animations (fade in/out) when filtering products.
- Load products dynamically from a JavaScript array or API.
